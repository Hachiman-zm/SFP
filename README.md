# SFP
Implementation of "A Compressive Prior Guided Mask Predictive Coding Approach for Video Analysis" in ACCV2022

The detailed introduction will be updated as soon as possible! 

Sorry for the possible delay because of the coming doctoral thesis proposal presentation and thesis defense.ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ 

## Environments
You will have to choose cudatoolkit version to match your compute environment. 
The code is tested on PyTorch 1.11.0 but other versions might also work. 

The version of python library is shown in [sfp.yaml](https://github.com/Hachiman-zm/SFP/blob/master/sfp.yaml) and [requirements.txt](https://github.com/Hachiman-zm/SFP/blob/master/requirements.txt). Many libraries may be unneccessary beacause SFP is tested on various VOS models.
